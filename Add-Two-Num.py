#This is the first example
num1 = 15      #num1 is a Variable , it contains 15
num2 = 195    #num2 is a Variable , it contains 195

#Adding two numbers
sum = num1+num2      #sum is a variable that is used to store the sum of num1 and num2
print(num1 ,"+", num2, "=",sum)

#The second example 
#The same is applied here
n1 = float(input("Give a Number :"))
n2 = float(input("Give a Number :"))

result = n1+n2
print(n1 ,"+", n2, "=",result)
